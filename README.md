# Worker Child

Children shouldn't be forced to work! This repo shows us why we can't pass certain args to `spawnSync` if we expect to run it in a worker thread. For additional context, see https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/1544 and https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/20873#issuecomment-1171528320

## Instructions

* Clone the repo
* Run `node spawnSync.mjs` and see the valid output.
* Now run `node index.mjs` and see the error which should look something like...

```bash
âžœ  worker_child node index.mjs

node:internal/event_target:912
  process.nextTick(() => { throw err; });
                           ^

```

Tested with both Node 16 and Node 18.

One solution to this issue could be to use `isMainThread` as shown in `isMainThreadSpawnSync.mjs`.
